# Sà'án Sàvǐ catch game
A videogame that teaches children the names of food items in Sà'án Sàvǐ (Yucunani Mixtec).

Sà'án Sàvǐ is spoken in the Yucunani village, in Oaxaca (Mexico). 
This game was created as a pedagogical resource for children. The original concept was developed
in Scratch as part of an assignment for LING 221 - Field Methods at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Language items have been collected by Jeremías Salazar (language advocate and educator).
Game design by Giorgia Troiani (PhD student in Linguistics).
